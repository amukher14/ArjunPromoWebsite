What did you change/enhance from part 1?
1. In the contact forms, the boxes will automatically clear the hint text of what the user should type
into each feild. 

2. I've added dynamic text box labeling in the contact section. So when the user clicks on a box and
forgets what they're supposed to type in it (from the hint in the box) they can refer to the label that dynamically appears once they
click on the field.

3. I've added form pre processing using axaj. This will determine if the emails entered match or not. If not a dialouge will dynamically
appear once the submit button is pressed. If the email's match then a success text will dynamically appear.

4. The user is no longer redirected to new a page when the submit button is pressed for the contact forms. Instead text appears
dynamically on the same page as described in 3.

*these changes can be found in the textChange.js file in the js folder.

If there was a third part to the class project, what would you like to implement?
I would like to probably learn more javacript libraries and frameworks. Otherwise I think the website is a really effective promotional
page and with the skills I have now I can tackle all kinds of projects

What did you learn between part 1 and part 2?
Learning about the DOM was really interesting for me. It helped me control elements to a much higher degree than I did before.
I didn't know how to make anything dynamic on the page before this. Javascript helped me learn about client side processing of info.

What did you like about this project? How could it have been better?
I liked this project because I gave me a chance to make a pretty impressive website from total scratch. The progession of information
learned with the class fit well with the project. I remember during the first part I was mad that my text boxs wouldn't automatically
clear themselves. But now I know how to fix that and more importantly why it fixes it. 
Altough the promotional page is nice, I wish there actually less freedom in and more guidelines on what we should implement for the page.
This helps me learn about many topics. However the excersices do a great job of doing this.
